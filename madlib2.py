    madlib = f"Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an)\
{adjetive1} amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool {plural_noun}\
and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my kind counselor shouted loudly,\
'Everybody off the {noun1}.' We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor\
handed out yellow tickets, and we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out\
what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so,\
{adverb1} ran over to get in the long line that had about {number1} people in it. When I finally\
got on the roller coaster I was {past_verb1}. In fact I was so nervous my two knees\
were knocking together. This was the {adjetive2} ride I had ever been on! In about two\
minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. Thatâ€™s when the ride began!\
When I got to the bottom, I was a little {past_verb2} but I was proud of myself. The rest\
of the day went {adverb2}. It was a(n) {adjetive3} day at the fun park."
